Usage: run this script on a machine that has Git installed (or to just write the files).
It will create/update these files relative to the repo root:
 - .github/workflows/playwright-artifacts.yml
 - PR_BODY.md
 - public/data/products.json

If git is present, the script can optionally commit and push the changes for you.

Title: E2E: restore fixtures and stabilize Playwright tests

Summary:
- Restored a small deterministic `public/data/products.json` fixture to ensure product grid renders reliably in headless E2E runs.
- Fixed minor frontend defensive code in `products-grid.js` to fallback to `localStorage` cart operations and ensure popup fragment population.
- Added a conservative CI workflow `.github/workflows/playwright-artifacts.yml` which runs Playwright on pushes/PRs and uploads test artifacts (reports, traces, screenshots) for easier debugging of failures.

Why:
- Playwright runs were failing due to malformed fixture data. Tests are now stable locally and we should run CI to confirm the same in GitHub Actions. The new workflow uploads artifacts to help debug any failures.

What to review:
- `public/data/products.json` (small fixture)
- `public/assets/js/products-grid.js` (popup and add-to-cart fallback)
- `.github/workflows/playwright-artifacts.yml` (new workflow)

How to test locally:
1. Run Playwright tests locally:
   - `npx playwright test --config=tests/playwright.config.mjs`
2. To run CI-like job locally, ensure node modules installed: `npm ci`, then run Playwright (the workflow uses `http-server` to serve `public`).

Notes:
- I did not remove or modify your existing workflows; the new workflow is additive and conservative. If you prefer to change your existing workflow instead, I can prepare a patch that updates it instead of adding a new file.
