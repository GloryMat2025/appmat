## ▶️ Usage

Run a mock capture locally (fast):

```bash
pnpm run shots:mock
```

Run the full capture/report pipeline (requires Playwright browsers & dev server):

```bash
pnpm run capture  # uses tools/capture.mjs to produce screenshots/traces
pnpm run shots:report
pnpm run shots:zip
```

---

## ⚡ Quick commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run shots:mock` | Generate mock screenshots |
| `pnpm run shots:report` | Create HTML gallery |
| `pnpm run shots:zip` | Archive latest run |
| `pnpm run shots:merge` | Merge and index results |
| `npm version patch\|minor\|major` | Manual version bump (optional) |


## 🧪 CI/CD Workflows

### **1️⃣ Smoke Test – `shots-smoke.yml`**
Runs on every push/PR to `main` or `shots-final`.

**Steps:**
- Install dependencies via `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Run:
  ```bash
  pnpm run shots:mock
  pnpm run shots:report
  pnpm run shots:zip
  pnpm run shots:merge
  ```

### **2️⃣ Version bump – `version-bump.yml`**
- Runs on pushes to `main`. Uses `standard-version`/`standard-version` style bumping to update `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, commit the changes and push a `vX.Y.Z` tag.

### **3️⃣ Release – `release.yml`**
Runs automatically whenever a tag is pushed (v1.1.0, etc.)

**Features:**

- Validates `shots/` artifacts exist (gallery + zip)
- Optionally checks for `release:` keyword in the last commit message to gate releases
- Generates changelog (using `metcalfc/changelog-generator`)
- Publishes a GitHub Release and uploads HTML + ZIP files

---

## 🔖 Version Bump & Auto CHANGELOG

The `version-bump.yml` workflow automates semantic version increments and changelog updates.

Commit prefix -> version bump mapping:

| Commit prefix | Version bump |
|---------------|--------------|
| `fix:`        | Patch        |
| `feat:`       | Minor        |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major   |

What the workflow does:

1. Scans recent commit messages on `main`.
2. Determines the appropriate bump level (major/minor/patch) from prefixes.
3. Runs `standard-version` (or equivalent) to update `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Commits the updated files and pushes a tag `vX.Y.Z`.
5. The tag push triggers the `release.yml` workflow which performs release generation and artifact upload.

Notes:
- Ensure commit messages follow the prefix convention above; otherwise, no bump will be performed.
- You can override automatic bumps by creating a PR with the desired version changes, but the CI flow expects the tag push to trigger releases.

---

If you'd like, I can add a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining commit message conventions and how to trigger a release (e.g., commit message examples and tag push instructions).

---

## 🧾 Conventional Commits

Use Conventional Commit prefixes to indicate intent and drive automated version bumps and changelog generation.

Examples:

- `feat: add new gallery layout`
- `fix: correct zip path`
- `docs: update README`
- `chore: cleanup workflow cache`

These prefixes feed the `version-bump.yml` workflow to decide whether to bump patch/minor/major.

---

## 📦 How releases work

- The `version-bump.yml` workflow bumps the package version on `main` when commit messages follow conventional style (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and pushes a tag like `v1.2.3`.
- The `release.yml` workflow is triggered by a tag push (`v*`). It performs the following high-level steps:
  1. Checkout full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) so commit message checks work.
  2. Run smoke steps that can generate the latest `shots/` outputs (mock or real captures).
  3. Generate an HTML gallery (`shots/gallery.html`) and zip the latest shots.
  4. Verify the gallery contains images and at least one zip is non-trivial (>= 1 KB). If verification fails the release is aborted.
  5. Generate a changelog and create a GitHub release with the changelog as the body.
  6. Upload `shots/gallery.html`, `shots/*.zip`, and `CHANGELOG.md` as release artifacts.

If you prefer artifacts to be pre-committed rather than generated in-job, the verify step can be moved to the start of the job (or made non-blocking).
