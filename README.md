## 🧭 Overview

**Appmat** is an automated screenshot, reporting, and release pipeline powered by Node.js and GitHub Actions.  
It streamlines project snapshots, HTML gallery generation, version bumping, changelog creation, and GitHub releases — all without manual steps.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🧪 **Automated Shots & Reports** via Playwright or mock runs  
- 🧰 **Cross-platform CI/CD** with `pnpm`, Node 20, and GitHub Actions  
- 🧱 **Auto Version Bump** (based on commit messages)  
- 🧾 **Auto CHANGELOG.md** generation  
- 🚀 **Automatic Releases** with uploaded gallery + ZIP artifacts  
- 🔒 **Release Guards** — only trigger if artifacts exist and pipeline passes

## ▶️ Usage

Run a mock capture locally (fast):

```bash
pnpm run shots:mock
```

Run the full capture/report pipeline (requires Playwright browsers & dev server):

```bash
pnpm run capture  # uses tools/capture.mjs to produce screenshots/traces
pnpm run shots:report
pnpm run shots:zip
```

## 📦 How releases work

- The `version-bump.yml` workflow bumps the package version on `main` when commit messages follow conventional style (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and pushes a tag like `v1.2.3`.
- The `release.yml` workflow is triggered by a tag push (`v*`). It performs the following high-level steps:
    1. Checkout full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) so commit message checks work.
    2. Run smoke steps that can generate the latest `shots/` outputs (mock or real captures).
    3. Generate an HTML gallery (`shots/gallery.html`) and zip the latest shots.
    4. Verify the gallery contains images and at least one zip is non-trivial (>= 1 KB). If verification fails the release is aborted.
    5. Generate a changelog and create a GitHub release with the changelog as the body.
    6. Upload `shots/gallery.html`, `shots/*.zip`, and `CHANGELOG.md` as release artifacts.

If you prefer artifacts to be pre-committed rather than generated in-job, the verify step can be moved to the start of the job (or made non-blocking).
