<#
Download and commit Roboto-Regular.ttf into docs/fonts/ and create a deterministic vendor commit.

Usage (PowerShell, run from repo root):
  .\scripts\vendor-roboto.ps1 -Commit

By default this script will:
 - ensure docs/fonts exists
 - download Roboto-Regular.ttf from Google Fonts (GitHub raw)
 - verify the downloaded file size looks sane
 - add and commit the font file to git with a clear commit message

This script requires network access and git on PATH. Run interactively to review before committing.
