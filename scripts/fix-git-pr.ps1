PowerShell helper: fix-git-pr.ps1

Usage (PowerShell):
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  cd <repo-root>
  pwsh ./scripts/fix-git-pr.ps1

What it does:
 - Checks presence of `git` and `gh` on PATH
 - Shows versions and auth status
 - Fetches origin and shows commits/diff between origin/main and current branch
 - If no commit delta, it can create an empty commit and push (confirm first)
 - Optionally runs `gh pr create` to open a draft PR (confirm first)

Outputs helpful diagnostic lines you can paste back to the assistant.
